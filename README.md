# multi-period-trading-via-convex-optimization
I served as a teaching assistant for Dr. Yassaee's convex optimization final project during Spring 2023. The project was inspired by the paper 'Multi-Period Trading via Convex Optimization,' available at this [link](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/OPT-023). The research proposal for this project can be found in the file 'Stock_Proposal.pdf'.
